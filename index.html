      <p>I'm currently creating a tool for IBM Cloud UI developers and designers called Cloud PAL. Cloud PAL standardizes how UIs are built resulting in a decrease in development time and more consistency in IBM Cloud's UI. Cloud PAL is a set of React components, utilities, API calls, and guidelines that is integrated into over 80% of the 100+ UI microservices on IBM Cloud. Many of the common UI elements rendered to the page, API requests being sent from the client, or integrated experiences you see in IBM Cloud are built using this tool. You can view the IBM Cloud Platform UI by registering for free on the <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.ibm.com">IBM Cloud</a> platform.
      </p>
      <p>I'm also driving improvements and leading UI strategy as the architect responsible for the Account, Billing, and Enterprise management UIs on IBM Cloud. These UIs provide an experience for IBM Cloud's large enterprise customers to keep track of their spend, separate services by projects, and govern how their team's can use IBM Cloud. You can view the <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.ibm.com/account">Account</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.ibm.com/billing">Billing</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.ibm.com/enterprise">Enterprise</a> experiences by registering for free on the IBM Cloud platform.

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>I started my career as a designer at IBM. As a designer, I learned design thinking techniques, prototyping, and how to uncover user needs through research, but most importantly, I learned the value of focusing on the user. After a year and half working as a designer on IBM Cloud, I took an opportunity to join the IBM Cloud engineering team as a front end developer. A coworker of mine once said, “if good design is good business then good development makes both possible”. As an engineer, I balanced my technical knowledge, design background, and focus on user’s needs to build scalable user experiences. I also helped change the engineering perspective from how fast can we ship features, to how can we build an experience that meets our user’s needs and differentiates us from our competitors. </p>
        <p>At the same time, I grew my technical skills. I converted legacy UIs from Dojo and Polymer to React and Redux, helped establish GraphQL as a middle layer for the front end, led teams and development projects using agile practices, mentored junior developers on best practices, researched how our user’s perceived performance on the platform that led to an overhaul on our loading states, created a component library and SDK that significantly increased the consistency of our UIs and decreased design and development time, and architected new patterns that enabled developer to share client side API requests, utilities, guidelines, and JS bundles across microservices.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 5 years I’ve worked on IBM Cloud I’ve held different roles, solved different problems, and worked with different teams, but across each project one thing has been consistent, a focus on the user.</p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>I was born in Texas, but grew up in California, just outside of San Francisco. I attended college at the University of Colorado, Boulder where I studied advertising, computer science, and web development. After graduating I spent the summer in Munich, Germany before moving to Austin, TX where I’ve lived since.</p>
        <p>On the weekends you can find me biking to the nearest swimming hole in town, or working on house projects. Most recently, I’ve been focused on creating an automatic chicken door opener using a Raspberry PI, and Arduino Nano. During the week, I spend my time cooking, playing computer games, and playing sports like running, hockey, or basketball. My go to dish lately has been a korma curry with tofu and veggies.</p>
        <p>To me nothing is more important than people. Whether it's family, friends, coworkers, or strangers I always strive to make sure everyone is included, heard, and comfortable. I find that being a part of a group that values each other always leads to the best memories. If you are interested in connecting or learning more about my work reach out and say hi. Better yet, if you’re in Austin and there isn’t a pandemic going on, let’s grab a beer!</p>
