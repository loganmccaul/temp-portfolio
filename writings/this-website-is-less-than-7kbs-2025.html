          I've attempted to build a site where I can blog numerous times. I've tried to create a custom structure with
          Vue. I've deployed to Github pages using Hugo. I've signed up for Medium and Substack. And yet, none of these
          have actually led to me writing more. I think that's because all of these options either took too much effort
          to set up or didn't allow for me to have the full customizability that I desired. I like writing. I like
          coding, and truthfully I don't need much to do either, but I do need control.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm writing this directly in VS Code in HTML. I shuold probably install a spell check extension, but really
          I'm not doing this to perfect my writing. I'm doing it because writing and coding is fun. I get enough of the
          challenging software engineering problems working with teams on web apps at work. Instead, with this website,
          I want to go back to what made me fall in love with web development in the first place: basic HTML, CSS, and
          JS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well actually there isn't any Javascript on this website. At least not at the time of me writing this. I'm not
          opposed to adding interactivity to my websites - I wrote a few scripts for <a target="_blank"
            href="https://loganandabby.com">my wedding website</a> to build a draggable, polaroid-esque, photo gallery -
          but for this website I want to see how far HTML, CSS, and some file organization can take me. And with some of
          the latest techniques the HTML and CSS can take interactivty pretty far. I can even do page transitions using
          the <a target="_blank" href="view-transition-api-2025.html">CSS view transition API.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          And this isn't one of those blog posts with the latest hacks to make your website faster. It's just simple
          HTML and CSS and HTML and CSS is fast. In fact if you avoid JS frameworks, CSS frameworks, testing, builds,
          package management, CI/CD pipelines, pull requests, and everything else that goes into a development lifecycle
          then the code is fast, both for the coder and the end user. The problem is that's not very sustainable for a
          business, or a team, or any piece of code that actually matters. Luckily, this is just some dude's musings so
          without much effort this website is less than 7 KBs.

        <h2>Downsides to not using a framework</h2>
        <p>
          There's really two major downsides to forgoing a framework. One is technical and annoying. The other is a bit
          more ephemereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first major downside is that I do have two components that are repeated throughout this website. Article
          page headers (my name and link back to home) and page footers (my contact info). If I wanted to change these I
          have two options, go to each article I've written or ask Claude Code to update each article. So far I haven't
          had to put these to the test. When I want to write something new I duplicate a previous article, change the
          name, delete the content, add a link on the home page, and then start writing. We'll see how long this lasts.
          There's a very real world where once I want to change the page header or footer I spend the time to abstract
          it into a Javascript script that inserts both into the DOM and loads on each page, potentially adding my first
          piece of JS code. I also have an (unserious) theory that DRY development patterns aren't as important anymore
          with the introduction of LLM
          coding agents. Can they just do the dirty
          work to keep repeated code up to date? For now, I've kept both simple and I don't plan to change my name or
          contact info any time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second major downside is that this website doesn't showcase any of my 10+ years of developing complex
          customer facing experiences using a variety of frameworks and tools. I'm in management now so to that may not
          be too important, but since this site exists as a hybrid portfolio and blog I sometimes worry that it doesn't
          properly represent the technical skills I still have. However, I often remind myself that what I expect
          from the staff engineers reporting to me is that they are making proper technical tradeoffs. Based on the
          (self defined) requirements for this website, going with just HTML and CSS might actually be the smart choice.
          Afterall, this website is less than 7 KBs and I really put no effort into performance.
